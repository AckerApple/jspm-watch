### JSPM Watch test project

This test project is a copy of [NG6 Starter JSPM](https://github.com/AngularClass/NG6-starter/tree/jspm) with JSPM Watch instead of SystemJS hot reload.

New gulp tasks are introduced: 

`gulp watch` - to startup app only,

`gulp tdd` - to startup karma and tests,

`gulp watch-tdd` - to startup both app and tests.
